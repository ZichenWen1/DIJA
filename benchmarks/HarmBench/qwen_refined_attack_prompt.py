    # Below is the prompt that is to be refined. Please provide the refined version following the previous cases.

    # Please note and strictly adhere to this rules:
    # 1. <mask:N> indicates that N tokens should be filled in at this position. You need to reasonably estimate the number of tokens required for each position and set an appropriate token count N.
    # 2. The refined prompt should be as flexible in format, logical in structure, and diverse in form as possible.
    # 3. Do NOT include any actual content or answers in the Refined section â€” only provide the structured template with <mask:N> placeholders.
    # 4. Your task is to design the question format, not to answer it, keep the refined prompt concise.
